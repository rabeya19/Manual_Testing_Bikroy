## 1. Introduction
This repository is dedicated to manual testing procedures and documentation for the project. Manual testing is a crucial step in ensuring the quality and reliability of the software.

This README will guide you through the various aspects of manual testing. I have manually tested on Registration and Login Page for https://bikroy.com/ which is an e-commerce website where user can buy or sell their products.

## 2. Test Case Writing
Test cases are a fundamental part of the testing process. They serve as a detailed guide for testers to follow while evaluating the software's functionality. When writing test cases:

- Use clear and concise language.
- Describe the preconditions necessary for the test.
- Specify the steps to execute the test.
- Define the expected outcome or results.

Here I have attached some of my test cases for Registration and Login Page:

## 3. Mind Map
A mind map is a visual representation of the test scope, test areas, and their relationships. You can create a mind map to gain a better understanding of the testing scope and identify areas that require more attention.

I have created a Mind Map for Bikroy using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) which I have attached in the repository.

## 4. Test Case Reporting
Test case reporting helps track the status of test cases, including their execution status and any issues encountered.

Here I have attached the progress and results of each test cases for Login and Regristration Page:

## 5. Bug Reporting
If you encounter any issues during test execution, report the developer. Include all relevant information, such as the steps to reproduce the issue, the environment details, and any supporting files or screenshots.

I have attached a bug reporting sample which contains the following information:

## 6. Test Matrices
Test matrices provide a summary of the test coverage, including the number of test cases executed, passed, failed, and pending. 

Ensure you regularly update and maintain these documents throughout the testing process to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.

I have attached a sample test metrices for my overall testing:
